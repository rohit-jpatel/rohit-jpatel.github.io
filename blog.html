		<p>02/07/2021 1:00 PM: Created Log File for CS523 Homework and Project Work. (2hrs)
		<p>02/08/2021 9:00 PM: Discussed some ideas related to Parallel Computing Climate stimulation model, Atmospheric stimulation, Acturial stimulation to start the topic research with Professor Scott Spetka.(30m)</p>
		<p>02/11/2021 8:00 PM: Researching on topic of Parallel computing and acturial stimulation. Read some information about this topic from internet and then learned about Monte Carlo Stimulation. (3hrs)
		<p>02/18/2021 10:00 PM: Completed the Homework for week 2. Learned about header file <mpi.h>. 
		     Found a intresting topics to work with when I searched for monte carlo simulation actuarial source code https://github.com/aserravalle/Monte-Carlo-Sim-Car-Insurance-Claims, https://www.slideshare.net/AdamConrad2/actuarial-application-of-monte-carlo-simulation-46703744.
		     I would like to further discuss about this with professor so that I could start the analysis on the existing code and see what we can add to make it more effecient with Parallel Computing. (2hrs)</p>
		<p>02/25/2021 9:00 PM: Brainstromed the ideas for project with Profesor Scott and landed on conclusion	 to go forward with Poputation Model. https://towardsdatascience.com/building-population-models-in-python-57f9e174d27d found this link to start to implement the code and once it is up and running try to implement the parllel approach for the population model. (3hrs) </p>
		<p>03/02/2021 10:00 PM: Worked on the the Population Model, overcame few errors and made code up and running. (3hrs)</p>
		<p>03/14/2021 7:00 PM: Completed the backlogged HW5 and created the Project Proposal. (2hrs) </p>
		<p>03/20/2021 8:00 PM: Worked on finding the Dataset for Fertility Rate with sufficient amount of data country by country. (1h 30m)</p>
		<p>03/27/2021 : I did not get chance to work on project this week.</p>
		<p>04/02/2021 : Drew a plan to apporch the code and how to make chances to the existing code to plot the fertility Graph serially. (2hrs)</p>
		<p>04/08/2021 : Started to develop the code with existing piece of code first by using only two data and few values given in the code statically.(3hrs)</p>
		<p>04/15/2021: Added the dataset. Made changes to the code to read the dataset dynamically and how it plots the graph serially. Overcame few errors along way faced while ploting the graph. (3hrs)</p>
		<p>04/20/2021: Changed the code to start with multiprocessing. Started with process class to implement in the code to multiprocess both readexcel function and also plot graph function. (3hrs)</p>
		<p>04/22/2021: Face multiple issue while working with process class. Decided to implement the pool class since it was faster for reading the data for the countries and extracting the x and y for plotting of the graph which was eaisliiy handled by maatplotlib for the animation and ploting the graph. (4hrs)</p>
		<p>04/23/2021: With implementation of Pool class observed the sequecing issue with how the x and y was sent after reading the data. Also the main issue that realised was with the missing the use of if __name__ = '__main__' this caused multiple obsrucles. (4hrs)</p>
		<p>04/24/2021: Again changed the code to get the value dynamically instead of static value. At this point it is a bit difficult to modify the code. I tried multiple scenarios and came up to keep atleast 2 values manatory and then growing the list as we need more values by add the front end. Still needs some work to work this correctly. (6hrs)</p>
		<p>04/25/2021: By adding the front end again I faced a few difficulties with Attribute Error and Assertion Error. So again I tried with static values to make the code functioning first with only two countries dataseta and made it working. (4hrs)</p>
		<p>04/27/2021: Now back to getting the value dynamically I  added a function in front end to process the growing list and passing it to the main code and then getting the x and y co-ordiantes in a form of gloabl list was a successful approach (3hrs)</p>
		<p>04/29/2021: Did set up of pycharm on other 2 laptop that I have with different cores. And then running the code on all three system first serially and then using Multiprocessing to check the difference in the result. (3hrs)</p>
		<p>04/30/2021: Outlined the Presentation and Points that needs to be included in the Presentation.(2hrs)</p>
		<p>05/01/2021: Created the Presentation and Assembled all the information that I gathered.(4hrs)</p>
		<p>05/02/2021: Prepared for the presenation.(2hrs)</p>
		<p>05/06/2021: Report Outline and Points to put in the Report.Created the Report.(4hrs) </p>
		<p>05/07/2021: Updated the website with all details as required.</p>
