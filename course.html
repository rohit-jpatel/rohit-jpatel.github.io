                <h3>Digital Automotive Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Digital and Smart Manufacturing sensing, control and information technologies in use in the automotive industry. This course explores the framework and definitions of Smart Manufacturing systems, information generation approaches and tradeoffs, signal processing and fusion strategies and their selection, and considerations for local (edge) computing and cloud analytics.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Lightweight Design Using Composites</h3>
                <p>Lightweight design using composites will cover the fundamental principles and applied engineering in designing composite structures. Starting from mapping the design requirements, the course reviews the materials selection strategies and explores various material models for composite modeling, including multiscale modeling approaches and how those models are enabled in the performance prediction of composite structures. Further, the course explores different composite manufacturing processes to better understand how to couple the materials models with their process design and response output to develop a manufacturing-to-response pathway. Overall, the composite design, modeling, process, and response architectures at the systems level will be explored to yield the optimal design of composite structures.</p>

            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Materials Selection in Engineering Design</h3>
                <p>Advanced study of various physical, chemical and mechanical materials properties which govern the selection of materials in engineering design. Case studies of materials selection in design with metals, ceramics, polymers and composites are presented.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="course-col">
                <h3>Quality Assurance for Automotive Manufacturing Systems</h3>
                <p>This course is designed to provide students with a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of statistical methods for automotive manufacturing and design applications using industry-recognized methodologies such as LEAN, Six Sigma, and IATF QMS. Unlike a traditional statistics theory class, this course seeks not only to give students a solid mastery of many basic statistical analysis tools, but also a broad understanding of how and when those tools may be most appropriately applied in a variety of applications, including: services, human resources, financial, manufacturing, research and development, and even social responsibility and sustainability aspects of the automotive industry.</p>
