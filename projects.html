                        <li><strong>Ergonomics and Operator Fatigue:</strong> Addressed operator fatigue by designing
                            workstations with adjustable height tables and ergonomic tools, such as padded grips and
                            low-force actuators. For example, a workstation was designed with an adjustable height to
                            accommodate operators of varying statures, reducing strain during extended use.</li>
                        <li><strong>Precision and Consistency:</strong> Overcame issues with component misalignment and
                            inconsistent assembly by integrating a vision-based alignment system that used cameras to
                            verify component placement and ensure precise assembly. This system significantly reduced
                            defects by providing real-time feedback.</li>

                            implementing automated material handling systems, such as conveyor belts with synchronized
                            speed control, to streamline the movement of components between assembly stations. This
                            reduced cycle time and minimized manual handling.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Enhanced Production Efficiency:</strong> Achieved a 25% reduction in assembly time
                            through optimized line layout and automation. For instance, the use of automated torque
                            drivers cut down manual tightening times by 40%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Product Quality:</strong> Reduced defect rates by 30% through the use of
                            vision-based alignment systems and custom fixtures that ensured precise component assembly.
                            For example, the integration of automated alignment checks reduced misaligned parts from 5%
                            to under 2%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operational Improvements:</strong> Increased throughput by 20% with the
                            implementation of a U-shaped assembly layout and automated material handling. The new layout
                            allowed for faster operator transitions and reduced waiting times.</li>
